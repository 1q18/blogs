Upgrading from MySQL <8.4 to MySQL >9.0 requires running MySQL 8.4 first:

We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:
    mysql_secure_installation
password:roottoor
MySQL is configured to only allow connections from localhost by default

To connect run:
    mysql -u root

To restart mysql after an upgrade:
  brew services restart mysql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir\=/opt/homebrew/var/mysql
==> nginx
Docroot is: /opt/homebrew/var/www

The default port has been set in /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/servers/.

To start nginx now and restart at login:
  brew services start nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/nginx/bin/nginx -g daemon\ off\;
